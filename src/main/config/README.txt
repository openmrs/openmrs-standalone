BACKGROUND
==========

The OpenMRS Standalone is a great way to evaluate and explore OpenMRS, getting you get a local copy of OpenMRS up and running within minutes.

OpenMRS Standalone provides a simplified installation option with an embedded database and web server.  Simply download, expand the archive, run the openmrs-standalone.jar file inside, and it will open your browser to your new OpenMRS instance.

We limited experience using OpenMRS Standalone in production environments. We expect it should run fine for smaller installations (less than 10,000 patient records), but if you're setting up a large production installation, we recommend doing a standard installation. (It is possible to start with the Standalone, and migrate data to a standard installation later.)

WARNINGS
========

- Do NOT delete or rename any folders after decompressing the zip file. They are used by the standalone jar file and it expects them to be in the exact locations where they already are.
- You MUST immediately change the admin password after installation for security purposes.
